# Car-Price-Prediction
The scope for future work is to collect as many data as we can so that the  model can be built more efficiently.
This is a flask web app which predicts the price of used Cars trained on the top of Random Forest Regressor model. The dataset contains information about used cars is taken from Kaggle listed on www.OLX.com. The trained model takes a data of used cars as a input and predict the Price of the Car as a output.
What could be a perfect way to utilize unfortunate lockdown period? Like most of you, I spend my time in online games, web series and coding. Last Year, I started to learn Data Science and Machine Learning course from online platform. I came to know mathematics behind all the supervised/unsupervised model but it is important to work on real world application to actually makes a difference. It is just a small initiative towards this.
This project is divided into two parts:
Trained a Machine Learning model using Random Forest Regressor(Code is available in this repo)
Deployed the model using Flask on Heroku Platform.
